<h2>THE ROLE OF THE POLICE IN SOUTH AFRICA AND IN TREVOR'S MEMOIR, BORN A CRIME IN COMPARATIVE WITH THE KENYAN POLICE.</h2>
<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>Trevor Noah grew up in South Africa during the system of racial segregation known as apartheid.  He has grown more comfortable at moving back and forth between jokes and earnest insights, between humor and serious asides — the way he’s done in his stand-up act, and now, in his compelling new memoir, “Born a Crime: Stories From a South African Childhood.”</p>
<p>In South Africa  and in Trevor Noah’s memoir, the role of the police has been depicted in various instances;</p>

<h2>ROLE OF THE POLICE IN SOUTH AFRICA AND IN TREVOR'S MEMOIR, BORN A CRIME IN COMPARATIVE WITH THE KENYAN POLICE.</h2>
<P>Trevor Noah’s memoir starts by stating the IMMORALITY ACT,1927  in South Africa which prohibits illicit carnal intercourse between Europeans and natives, Found guilty, men can go to prison for up to five years and women for up to four.</P>
<P>“Apartheid was a police state, a system of surveillance and laws designed to keep black people under total control. A full compendium of those laws would run more than 3,000 pages and weigh approximately 10 pounds, but the general thrust of it should be easy enough for any American to understand,” Trevor  writes this at the end of chapter 1, RUN. “In America, you had the forced removal of the native onto reservations coupled with slavery followed by segregation. Imagine all of those things happening to the same group of people at the same time. That was apartheid.”</P>
<P> Trevor Noah is the son of Patricia who is  Xhosa and a Swiss-German father, Robert. The law didn’t allow Trevor to openly walk with neither his mother nor his  father. Trevor recalls that “the only time I could be with my father was indoors”: “If we left the house, he’d have to walk across the street from us.” It was dangerous, as a light-skinned child, to be seen with his mother as well: “She would hold my hand or carry me, but if the police showed up she would have to drop me </P>
<p>Under apartheid, whites, blacks, colored people, and Indians are all forced onto separate lands; entire police squads enforce the law against race mixing (although, in practice, whites usually manage to sidestep punishment). Patricia moves from Soweto to downtown Johannesburg which was illegal because downtown was reserved for the whites and blacks were harassed by the police and have to carry passes and return in  the township at night.  </p>
<p>There was also the general harassment of black people in a number of ways on the basis of a generalised suspicion and identification of black people as likely perpetrators of crime.</p>
<p>The policeman’s job was to protect the people, when Trevor and his mom jumped out of the minibus, they run twenty-four-hour petrol station and called the police and expected the police to drive them home.</p>
<p>It was the policeman's duty to arrest those who break laws.Even in Kenya when someone steals he/she is arrested.When Trevor and Teddy steals liquor-filled chocolates from the mall, a cop sees them and starts to chess them where Teddy gets arrested and accused for shoplifting.
</p>

<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
<p>During the apartheid regime most of the policemen's job was to make sure that the wrong color, the blacks weren't doing anything wrong.The police harassed and oppressed the black people and were excluded.When Nelson Mandela was released from prison and the apartheid was called off and the blacks started gaining their rights.In Kenya, the police don't discriminate but have the same behavioural characters.</p>
