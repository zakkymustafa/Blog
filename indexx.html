   <h1>WHEN LOVE TURNS TOXIC</h1>
   <p>“It’s not as if I don’t know you!” She exclaimed, it has always been the same story of you cheating on me. It’s not like it’s the first time you are sleeping with someone else, this is the 100th time for God’s Sake. </p>
   <p>This was Sarah’s tantrums each day, and still there she was, beside the man who crashes her heart. It was as if she was doomed to stay with Alex all her life, indeed she was screwed in all ways. Each morning she would wake up stranded, beside a man who came back drunk past midnight.</p>
   <p>“Sarah, how long will you keep up with all these abuses? No single day that I haven’t seen you crying, enough is enough, we are going home.” Susan asked. “But I love him, I can’t imagine my life without him Susan, just leave me alone I don’t want your help, I will manage my life on my own I don’t want your help, thank you.” Sarah responded angrily. This was mostly Sarah’s response every time Susan tried to help her.</p>
   <p>Susan left and promised to never interfere with Sarah’s life, she can’t continue seeing her best friend suffer. Soon after Sarah was called for an urgent meeting at her workplace, she picked herself up, applied makeup to her bruises and scars like each time, to cover them, but for how long will she cover what’s hidden inside her heart, the depression, the hurts and the trauma.</p>
   <p>Sarah headed out to the office and was informed that she had to travel urgently to South Africa for some urgent business. There she was, at the airport still thinking about Alex, contemplating whether to go or stay behind in fear that Alex will definitely cheat like always.</p>
   <p>Thoughts kept on crisscrossing her mind, but she had to, for once she thought about herself.</p>
